- Collecting life rewards and managing a 3-life system

## üéØ Game Rules

### Scoring System
- **+1 point** for each male successfully assigned to a urinal
- **No points** for cubicle assignments (but they help manage the queue)
- **Life rewards** occasionally appear on facilities (collect for extra lives)

### Life System
- **Start with 3 lives** (displayed as diaper icons in UI)
- **Lose 1 life** for timeouts (male has accident on floor)
- **Lose 1 life** for adjacency violations (placing males in adjacent urinals)
- **Game Over** when all lives are lost
- **Gain lives** by using facilities with life reward indicators

### Restroom Etiquette Rules
1. **No Adjacent Urinals**: Males cannot use urinals next to each other
2. **Cubicles Can Be Adjacent**: Cubicles have privacy, so adjacency is allowed
3. **Timeout Prevention**: Assign males before their patience runs out (12 seconds)

### Difficulty Progression

- **Dynamic Scaling**: Difficulty increases every 10 points
- **Spawn Rate**: Decreases by 150ms per difficulty level (min 800ms)
